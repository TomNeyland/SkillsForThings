description: Use when writing commit messages during greenfield product-building sessions, multi-commit feature series, or any session that will produce more than 5 commits. Also use when the commit history is itself serving as the product's design narrative (e.g., an investor will read `git log`, or the session is being captured as a skill).

# Autonomous Build — Commit Essays

![Given a non-trivial feature commit, write the subject and short body while the reasoning is fresh, naming who needs the change, what it enables, and which behavior or tradeoff future work must preserve; the message is complete when a future developer can recover product intent without reconstructing the diff.](assets/autonomous-build-commit-essays.png)

## Overview

Every commit message is a short essay explaining **why this feature matters** and **what product semantics it adds** — not just what code changed. Strung together, these messages become the product's design narrative. Someone scrolling `git log` learns WHY the product is the way it is, not just WHAT changed.

## When to Use

- Greenfield product session (>5 commits expected)
- Building a differentiation story someone will read later
- Autonomous session where `git log` is the audit trail
- Pair with `autonomous-build-purpose-layers` — each layer's commit explains its arc-position

## When NOT to Use

- Mechanical refactors (rename, format, dep bump) — one-line subject suffices
- Merge commits — default is fine
- Sessions with a single big commit — write a PR description instead

## Core Pattern

Every non-trivial commit gets:

1. **Subject line** (`<type>(<scope>): <imperative feature name>`)
   - `feat(alerts): anomaly-aware thresholds — dynamic bands beat static cutoffs`
2. **Body paragraph 1** — why this matters / what handoff it enables
   - Ground in the product's arc / audience ("this is the handoff between X and Y", "users hit this every single day", "the number stakeholders argue about")
3. **Body bullets** — key details worth preserving
   - Gotchas, provenance, cross-references to commits or issues, trade-offs
4. **(Optional) closing line** — a one-sentence business/product framing
   - "This is the 'set it up once, every future run inherits it' feature that makes the whole layering strategy pay off."
5. **Co-authorship** — if agent-authored, say so

## Example

```
feat(alerts): anomaly-aware alert thresholds

Static thresholds miss slow drift and over-fire on seasonal spikes.
Given a metric's rolling baseline (mean, stddev over a trailing
window W) and a sensitivity level (low / medium / high), compute a
dynamic threshold band and only fire once the metric has breached it
for N consecutive samples.

Outputs:
  - dynamic threshold band (upper/lower, per sensitivity level)
  - current value vs. band position
  - consecutive-breach counter
  - recommendation: no-action / watch / page

Closes the "is this actually broken or just noisy" question every
on-call engineer asks at 3am: not just "did it cross a number" but
"has it stayed wrong long enough to matter."

## Quick Reference

| Commit kind | Minimum body |
|-------------|--------------|
| New view / semantic layer | 1 paragraph WHY + bullet substance + closing framing |
| Feature extension | 1 paragraph on what this enables that wasn't possible |
| Infrastructure | 1 paragraph + which downstream commits this unblocks |
| Bug fix | 1 line subject enough; essay optional |
| Refactor / format / dep | 1 line subject |

## Red Flags — rewrite the message

- Subject only, no body, for a new feature
- Body = literal description of the diff ("added X function to Y file")
- No audience named (who cares about this? who will notice?)
- No connection to a product arc / purpose layer
- Message could apply to 10 different features (too generic)

## Common Mistakes

- **Diff summarization**: "feat: add threshold panel" — reader learns what was added, not why it matters.
- **Version-bump style**: "chore: update X to 1.2.3" — fine for deps, not for features.
- **Passive voice tense**: "The threshold panel was added..." — use imperative ("add threshold panel").
- **Orphan commits**: commits disconnected from any named arc. Every feature commit should ground in a purpose layer.
- **Writing later**: ALWAYS write the message as part of the commit, with the work fresh. Retroactive messages lose the "why".

## Real-World Impact

In a 30+ commit session written this way, `git log` alone told the product's story well enough that new agents, reviewers, and investors could onboard from it in 10 minutes — the history doubled as the pitch deck.
